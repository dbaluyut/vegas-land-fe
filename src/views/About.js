              Bereket Girma is a Web Developer based in Las Vegas. She's built
              web applications using Node.js and React and has a solid
              foundation in web design and development. She recently completed
              PunchCodeâ€™s web development bootcamp. Before moving into
              development, she worked in the Health sector, where she managed
              and converted voice recordings that physicians and other
              healthcare workers make into written reports. When she is not
              coding, she enjoys spending time with family and learning
              different cultures and their languages. Right now she is looking
              for a suitable position with a company where outstanding
              performance is recognised and where she can work on a variety of
              projects.

              Though not a Las Vegas native, Derrique has come to love the city
              after moving from Anchorage, Alaska back in 2014. Derrique is a
              Jack of all trades. His experiences vary from the Tradeshow
              industry to working for a Civil Engineering firm, Retail and F&B.
              All of which helped in bringing everything together for Vegaland.
              He is both design literate and detail oriented. His dedication to
              any project proves himself to be a great asset to whatever team he
              finds himself in. Outside of work, he enjoys everything from
              snowboarding to gaming to listening to Jazz and Lofi music to
              admiring Woodwork, Architecture, Design, History and Technology
              just like the jack of all trades that he is.
